# Almond

Almond is a unified client for Develop for Good members to access in-house as
well as off-the-shelf AI models.

Built with love.

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have Node.js installed (preferably LTS).
- Install dependencies: `pnpm install` command:
  `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`.
- Invoke the start script, e.g. `pnpm dev`

No docker image is available yet, but that is on the roadmap to make builds
easier.
